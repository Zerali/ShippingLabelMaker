For this project I wanted to leverage the newer features of react such as hooks. I ended up using `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, `Context`, and `useEffect`. This caused me to deviate from the requirements in a couple places. I also leveraged `react-bootstrap` to get basic styling and grid layout.

In order to run the project you must clone the repository then run `npm install` followed by `npm run start` in the console.
